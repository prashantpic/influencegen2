# This module primarily provides services and controllers.
# Access to ir.config_parameter is typically restricted to base.group_system.
# The public callback endpoint has custom token authentication.
# Services are called internally by other Odoo components (controllers, models)
# which operate within their own security context.
# If this module were to define its own non-abstract models requiring UI access,
# ACLs would be added here.
# Example for a hypothetical model:
# access_influence_gen_ai_config_admin,influence_gen.ai.config.admin,model_influence_gen_ai_config,base.group_system,1,1,1,1
