# This file is part of an Odoo module structure.
# It is typically left empty if all data is loaded via XML files
# listed in the __manifest__.py file.
#
# Python code for data loading (e.g., using @api.model_create_multi
# in a model or custom setup hooks) would be rare for simple data files
# but could be placed here or in a more specific `data_hooks.py` if complex
# programmatic data setup is required during module installation or update.
