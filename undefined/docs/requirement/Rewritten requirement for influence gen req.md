            a) OAuth-based verification if supported by the social media platform and suitable for this purpose, allowing the system to confirm account identity without accessing credentials.
            b) Requiring the influencer to temporarily place a unique, system-generated alphanumeric code in their social media profile biography or as a public post on their account, which is then programmatically or manually verified by the system.
            c) Other industry-standard, secure verification techniques that effectively confirm account ownership while prioritizing user credential security and privacy.
            The system must not request, capture, or store social media login credentials (usernames/passwords) or sensitive session information like 2FA codes.
        *   Bank account verification for payouts:
            *   Influencer submits bank account details (e.g., account number, routing number, IBAN/SWIFT).
            *   Verification may be achieved through:
                *   Integration with secure third-party services (e.g., Plaid, Stripe Connect). These integrations must handle sensitive financial data securely, potentially using tokenization and adhering to PCI DSS compliance if card data were involved. [Highlights security for financial data]
                *   Micro-deposit verification.
                *   Manual verification by administrators based on submitted documentation (e.g., bank statement).
            *   Success/failure criteria for bank account verification must be defined as explicit business rules.
        *   Agreement to the platform's Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy. Influencers must explicitly consent before their account is activated. The ToS shall clearly outline policies regarding PII handling, content ownership, usage rights for campaign-submitted content, and data retention, including how these interact with GDPR rights. These policies constitute binding legal constraints and business rules for the platform. The system must log the timestamp and version of ToS/Privacy Policy agreed to by the user. [Essential for legal compliance and record-keeping]

*   N8N generates images using specified AI models, primarily "Flux LoRA models," based on the received prompts and parameters.
*   N8N returns the generated images (preferably image data directly, or a temporary secure link to the image data if direct data transfer is not feasible) back to the Odoo system by calling a dedicated Odoo API endpoint (callback). If a link is provided, Odoo is responsible for immediately downloading the image and storing it in its managed storage for use by the influencer or platform administrators.
*   **4.4.1 Prompt Management**
    *   Users shall be able to input text prompts for image generation.
    *   The system should allow saving and reusing frequently used prompts or parts of prompts.
    *   Administrators may have the ability to create and manage template prompts for specific campaign styles or themes.
    *   The system shall implement content moderation/filtering for prompts to prevent the generation of inappropriate or harmful content, where feasible. The specific rules for content moderation are business rules to be defined and maintained by platform administrators. This may involve integration with a third-party content moderation API or a built-in denylist/keyword filtering mechanism. [Specifies potential implementation approaches]
*   **4.4.2 Configurable Parameters**
    *   Users shall be able to configure various parameters for image generation, including but not limited to:
        *   Image Resolution (e.g., 512x512, 1024x1024)
        *   Aspect Ratio (e.g., 1:1, 16:9, 9:16)
        *   Negative Prompts (to specify what not to include)
        *   Seed (for reproducibility)
        *   Number of Inference Steps
        *   CFG Scale
        *   Selection of specific Flux LoRA models/weights if multiple are available and configured by administrators. Administrators should be able to manage the list of available LoRA models and their associated metadata (e.g., name, description, trigger keywords if applicable) within Odoo. [Administrative feature for model management]
    *   The Odoo interface shall provide intuitive controls for these parameters. Default values and permissible ranges for these parameters should be configurable by administrators and are considered business rules.
*   **4.4.3 Image Storage and Access**
    *   Generated images, whether returned as data or via a temporary link from N8N, must be securely stored in a solution managed and controlled by the InfluenceGen system (as detailed in Section 5.3.3). If N8N provides a link, Odoo shall download the image from this link and store it in its managed storage. The original temporary link from N8N should not be considered the permanent storage location.
    *   Images stored in the InfluenceGen-controlled storage must be accessible to Odoo and authorized users.
    *   Generated images shall be associated with the user who generated them and, if applicable, the campaign for which they were generated.
    *   Access controls for viewing and using generated images within Odoo shall be enforced.
    *   The system shall distinguish between images generated for personal exploration (if any) and images formally submitted to a campaign, applying potentially different data handling and retention rules as per Section 7.3. This distinction and associated rules are business rules.
*   **4.4.4 Usage Tracking**
    *   The system shall track AI image generation usage. Metrics to track include:
        *   Number of images generated per user.
        *   Number of images generated per campaign.
        *   API call counts to the AI generation service.
        *   Timestamp of generation requests.
    *   This data shall be used for:
        *   Enforcing user/role-based quotas (which are business rules).
        *   Platform analytics and resource planning.
        *   Potential future billing or cost allocation.
    *   Administrators shall have access to reports or dashboards displaying usage tracking data.

**4.5 Post-Onboarding Influencer Workflow**
*   Upon successful completion of the onboarding and KYC verification process, the influencer's account shall be activated.
*   Activated influencers shall gain access to the main functionalities of the InfluenceGen platform within Odoo, including:
    *   Their personalized dashboard.
    *   Campaign discovery features (Section 4.3.2).
    *   Profile management to update their information (excluding KYC-verified data without re-verification, as per defined business rules for data integrity).
    *   AI image generation tools (subject to permissions and quotas, Section 4.4).
*   The system should provide a clear and intuitive navigation path for newly onboarded influencers to explore and engage with these features.
*   Initial guidance or tooltips may be provided to help influencers understand how to participate in campaigns and use platform tools.

---

**5. External Interface Requirements**

**5.1 User Interfaces**
*   All InfluenceGen functionalities integrated into Odoo shall adhere to Odoo's existing UI/UX design language and standards to ensure a consistent user experience. This includes using Odoo's web framework (OWL - Odoo Web Library) for custom UI components. [Specifies Odoo frontend technology]
*   The user interface for influencer-facing features (portal) must be intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate for users with varying technical skills.
*   The user interface for administrative functions must be efficient and provide necessary tools for managing the platform.
*   Specific UI requirements for AI image generation:
    *   Clear input fields for prompts and negative prompts.
    *   Intuitive controls for selecting parameters (e.g., sliders, dropdowns).
    *   A clear way to display generated images, including options to download or use them within Odoo.
    *   Feedback mechanisms during image generation (e.g., progress indicators). The UI must clearly indicate that image generation is in progress after initiation.
    *   The UI should update dynamically to display the image once it's received from N8N via the callback, without requiring a page reload.
*   Wireframes or mockups for key user interfaces and workflows shall be developed during the design phase to validate usability. These should be reviewed and approved by stakeholders before development. [Ensures alignment]

**5.2 Hardware Interfaces**
*   No specific custom hardware interfaces are anticipated for this project. The system will rely on standard web client hardware (PCs, mobile devices) and server infrastructure.

**5.3 Software Interfaces**
*   **5.3.1 Odoo - N8N Integration**
    *   Communication between Odoo and N8N for image generation shall be asynchronous. Odoo will trigger N8N workflows by calling N8N webhooks. N8N will communicate results back to Odoo by calling a dedicated Odoo REST API endpoint (callback URL) upon completion of the image generation. For other integrations, communication may use REST APIs. The Odoo callback endpoint must be secured and capable of handling concurrent requests from N8N. [Security and performance consideration for the callback]
    *   Odoo may trigger N8N workflows by calling N8N webhooks.
    *   N8N may communicate results back to Odoo by calling Odoo's REST APIs or XML-RPC/JSON-RPC APIs if more suitable for specific tasks, or a dedicated callback URL for asynchronous operations like image generation.
    *   Data exchange shall use JSON format.
    *   Authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, tokens) must be implemented to secure this communication.
*   **5.3.2 N8N - AI Image Generation Service**
    *   N8N will integrate with an AI image generation backend service that hosts and runs the "Flux LoRA models." This backend could be a commercial API (e.g., Stability AI, Replicate, or similar services supporting custom LoRA models) or a self-hosted solution (e.g., ComfyUI, Automatic1111 with an API). The specific service will be determined during the detailed design/implementation planning phase. The integration should be designed to be adaptable to different AI service APIs with minimal code changes, potentially using an adapter pattern. [Promotes flexibility]
    *   Integration will typically be via REST APIs provided by the AI service.
    *   Authentication will use methods specified by the AI service (e.g., API keys).
*   **5.3.3 Image Storage Solution**
    *   The authoritative storage for generated images must be a secure and scalable solution under the InfluenceGen system's control. Options include: Cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) managed by the Odoo application, or Odoo's internal filestore, if deemed sufficiently scalable and performant for the expected volume of images. If cloud storage is used, consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for optimized image delivery to users. [Performance enhancement for image serving]
    *   If N8N returns a link to an image (e.g., from an external AI service's temporary storage), Odoo must treat this link as a source to download the image data. The image data must then be stored in one of the aforementioned InfluenceGen-controlled storage solutions. The system should prioritize N8N returning image data directly to Odoo to simplify this process.
    *   The choice of storage solution will be made during the design phase, considering cost, scalability, security, integration effort, and data residency requirements (which are legal/business constraints). [Adds data residency as a factor]
    *   Access to stored images must be controlled, potentially using signed URLs or other secure token-based mechanisms if stored externally but managed by Odoo.
    *   Odoo must be able to retrieve and display these images seamlessly.
*   **5.3.4 KYC Verification Services (Optional)**
    *   If third-party services are used for ID verification or bank account verification (e.g., Jumio, Onfido, Plaid, Stripe Connect), the system must integrate with their respective APIs.
    *   Integration details, including API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication, will depend on the chosen service(s).
    *   Secure handling of sensitive data exchanged with these services is paramount. Data minimization principles should be applied, only exchanging necessary information with third-party KYC services. [Data privacy best practice]
*   **5.3.5 Payment Gateway Integration (Potential)**
    *   For automating payouts, integration with payment gateways or banking APIs might be considered in conjunction with Odoo's accounting features. This is a potential future enhancement and specific requirements would be detailed if pursued. Adherence to PCI DSS (if card data is handled directly) or other relevant financial regulations is a mandatory business constraint for such integrations.

**5.4 Communication Interfaces**
*   All communication involving sensitive data (PII, KYC data, financial information, API keys) over networks must use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS). TLS 1.3 should be preferred where supported, with TLS 1.2 as a minimum. [Specifies current TLS best practices]
*   Email notifications will be used for various system events (e.g., registration confirmation, KYC status updates, campaign notifications). Odoo's standard email sending capabilities will be utilized. Configuration for SMTP server and email templates should be manageable within Odoo. [Standard Odoo practice]

---

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**

**6.1 Performance Requirements**
*   **AI Image Generation API Response Time:**
    *   The system should aim for a *total turnaround time* for image generation where the majority of typical requests (e.g., standard resolution images, moderately complex prompts utilizing Flux LoRA models) are processed by N8N, and the image is made available in Odoo (via callback) within an average of 10-20 seconds from the initial request by the user in Odoo.
    *   It is acknowledged that factors such as:
        a) AI model "cold starts" (initial loading time if the model is not actively warmed).
        b) The complexity of the generation request (e.g., higher resolution, intricate details, number of iterations).
        c) The size of the generated image data and subsequent data transfer times.
        d) N8N workflow processing overhead and any intermediate steps.
        can lead to variations and potentially longer response times for specific requests.
    *   The system should provide clear feedback to the user if an image generation request is initiated and is expected to take longer than the typical average (as per Section 5.1).
    *   The system should be designed to handle responses that may exceed this target range without timing out prematurely, utilizing this asynchronous processing mechanism where Odoo is notified upon completion via a callback.
    *   Performance will be a key area for ongoing monitoring, analysis, and optimization efforts.
*   **Odoo User Interface Responsiveness:**
    *   Standard Odoo pages and InfluenceGen specific views should load within 3 seconds for 95% of requests under typical load conditions.
    *   Interactive elements (e.g., form submissions, filter applications) should provide feedback or complete within 2 seconds.
*   **KYC Process:**
    *   Automated steps in the KYC process (e.g., API calls to verification services) should complete within 10 seconds per step.
    *   Manual review turnaround times will be defined by operational SLAs, which are business constraints.
*   **Influencer Registration:**
    *   The initial registration form submission (excluding KYC document uploads) should process within 5 seconds.
*   **Throughput:**
    *   The system should support at least **100-200** concurrent users (mix of influencers and admins) during peak hours without significant degradation in performance. This target should be validated through stress testing. [Ensures requirements are met]
    *   The onboarding module should be able to process at least **50-100** new influencer registrations per hour, with the capacity to handle short peaks of up to **150** registrations per hour.

**6.2 Security Requirements**
*   **Data Protection Compliance:** The system must be designed, developed, and maintained in compliance with applicable data protection regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Adherence to these regulations is a fundamental business and legal constraint. This includes respecting the influencer's rights regarding their PII, balanced with the platform's and brand's legitimate interests and contractual obligations for campaign content, as outlined in the ToS and Section 7.3.
*   **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data, including influencer Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial details, and any collected KYC data, must be encrypted both at rest (e.g., AES-256) and in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher, with TLS 1.3 preferred) using strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms.
*   **Access Control:** Access controls must be implemented based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring users can only access data and functionalities necessary for their roles.
*   **Password Policies:** The system shall enforce strong password policies for all user accounts, including minimum length, complexity requirements (mix of character types), and regular expiry, as defined by organizational security policy (a business constraint). Password hashing must use strong, salted algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) must be implemented for administrator accounts and strongly recommended as an option for influencer accounts. [Significant security enhancement]
*   **Web Vulnerability Protection:** The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities as outlined in the OWASP Top 10 (e.g., Injection, Broken Authentication, XSS, CSRF). Adherence to OWASP guidelines is an industry standard and a security business rule for the platform. Regular vulnerability scanning (automated and manual) should be part of the development lifecycle. [Proactive security measure]
*   **API Security:**
    *   All APIs (Odoo-N8N, N8N-AI service, external service integrations) must be secured using robust authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and authorization mechanisms.
    *   API keys and other credentials must be stored securely (e.g., using Odoo's secrets management or dedicated secrets management tools) and not hardcoded in source code.
    *   Rate limiting should be implemented on APIs to prevent abuse, based on defined business rules for acceptable usage.
*   **Secure Credential Management:** Secure management and rotation policies for all system credentials (API keys, database passwords, service accounts) must be established and followed as per organizational security policy.
*   **Security Audits:** Regular security audits and penetration testing should be planned and conducted (e.g., annually or post-major releases) as per organizational compliance requirements.
*   **N8N Security:** N8N workflows handling sensitive data must be designed securely, and access to the N8N instance itself must be controlled. This includes network-level access controls and strong authentication for N8N administrative interfaces.
*   **6.2.1 Data Masking/Anonymization for Non-Production Environments:** Sensitive PII (e.g., KYC data, financial details) must be masked or anonymized in development and testing environments to protect data while allowing for realistic testing, in compliance with data privacy regulations.
*   **6.2.2 Incident Response Plan:** A documented incident response plan shall be in place to address security breaches, outlining steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis. This plan should be regularly reviewed and tested, forming part of the organization's operational business rules.

**6.3 Usability Requirements**
*   The user interface within Odoo for interacting with InfluenceGen features, including image generation, must be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring minimal training for target users.
*   **Key Usability Goals:**
    *   Efficiency: Users should be able to complete common tasks (e.g., applying for a campaign, submitting content, generating an image) with a minimal number of steps.
    *   Effectiveness: Users should be able to achieve their goals accurately.
    *   Satisfaction: Users should have a positive experience interacting with the system.
*   **Target User Groups and Technical Proficiency:**
    *   Influencers: May have varying levels of technical proficiency; the interface must be simple and self-explanatory.
    *   Platform Administrators: Expected to be proficient with Odoo; the interface can be more feature-rich but must remain organized and efficient.
*   Error messages should be clear, informative, and suggest corrective actions.
*   The system shall provide consistent navigation and terminology throughout the InfluenceGen modules.
*   User documentation (guides, FAQs) shall be easily accessible. Consider in-app guidance (e.g., tooltips, tours) for key features, especially for influencers. [Enhances learnability]

**6.4 Reliability Requirements**
*   The integration points between Odoo, N8N, and the AI image generation services must be robust, with appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.
    *   **Error Handling:** Define specific error handling procedures for critical integration points: how errors are logged, how they are communicated to Odoo/user, retry logic (number of retries, backoff strategy), and handling of persistent failures (e.g., dead-letter queues, manual intervention alerts). These procedures are operational business rules.
*   **Uptime Target:** The core InfluenceGen platform functionalities within Odoo should aim for an uptime of 99.9% during business hours. Dependencies on external services (N8N, AI service) will affect overall end-to-end reliability. SLAs for external services should be documented and considered business constraints.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:**
    *   Regular backups of Odoo database (including InfluenceGen data) must be performed according to organizational policy.
    *   Recovery Point Objective (RPO): **1 hour** (maximum acceptable data loss). This is a critical business constraint.
    *   Recovery Time Objective (RTO): **4 hours** (maximum acceptable downtime for recovery). This is a critical business constraint.
    *   Backup and recovery procedures must be documented and tested periodically (e.g., quarterly) to ensure effectiveness. [Validates recovery capability]
*   **6.4.1 Fault Tolerance:** Critical system components should be designed for fault tolerance to minimize single points of failure. This may involve redundancy for Odoo application servers, database servers, and N8N instances.

**6.5 Scalability Requirements**
*   The system must be designed to scale to accommodate growth in the number of users, campaigns, and data volume.
*   **Concurrent Users:** The system should be designed to initially support **200-500** concurrent users (influencers and administrators) and be architected to scale to **1000+** concurrent users without performance degradation.
*   **Total Influencers:** The system should be designed to manage a database of at least **10,000** active influencers initially, with the capacity to scale to **100,000+** influencers.
*   **Registration Rate:** The system should handle an average of **100-200** new influencer registrations per day, with peaks up to **500** per day during marketing pushes.
*   **Image Generation Volume:** The system should support up to **5,000-10,000** image generation requests per day, with the architecture allowing for scaling beyond this volume.
*   **Data Storage Growth:** Anticipate storage growth for influencer profiles, KYC documents, campaign data, and generated images. The chosen storage solutions (Section 5.3.3) must be scalable.
*   The architecture should allow for scaling of individual components (Odoo application servers, database, N8N instances, AI model serving infrastructure) as needed. This may involve horizontal scaling (adding more instances) and/or vertical scaling (increasing resources of existing instances). Consider containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for Odoo, N8N, and AI services to facilitate scalability and deployment. [Specifies common scaling strategies and enabling tech]

**6.6 Accessibility Requirements**
*   Influencer-facing interfaces (Odoo portal) shall adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities. Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA is an industry standard and a business requirement for inclusivity.
*   This includes considerations for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and alternative text for images. Accessibility testing should be part of the QA process. [Ensures compliance]

**6.7 Maintainability Requirements**
*   The code shall be well-documented, modular, and follow Odoo development best practices to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements. This includes writing unit tests and integration tests for custom modules. Consider adopting a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. [Improves code quality and deployment efficiency]
*   Configuration parameters (e.g., API endpoints, default settings) should be externalized and manageable without code changes where possible.
*   The system design should allow for updates and upgrades to Odoo, N8N, and integrated services with minimal disruption.
*   **6.7.1 Code Quality Standards:** Defined coding standards and practices (e.g., linting, static analysis, code reviews), as per organizational development guidelines (business rules), shall be enforced for all custom Odoo module development and N8N workflow configurations.
*   **6.7.2 Version Control:** All custom code, Odoo module configurations, N8N workflows, and IaC scripts must be managed under a version control system (e.g., Git), with branching strategies and commit guidelines defined by organizational policy.

**6.8 Localization and Internationalization**
*   The system shall initially be developed in English.
*   The design should consider future support for multiple languages and regions for influencer-facing content and UI elements.
*   If localization is required, target languages will be specified (e.g., Spanish, French, German). Textual elements in the UI should be designed for easy translation (e.g., using Odoo's translation mechanisms). Odoo's built-in translation management tools should be utilized for managing translations. [Leverages Odoo features]
*   The system should support localization of date, time, number, and currency formats based on user preferences or regional settings, adhering to international standards.

---

**7. Data Management**

**7.1 Data Model Requirements**
*   Detailed data models (database schema or data structures) shall be defined during the design phase for key entities, including but not limited to:
    *   Influencer Profile (personal, contact, professional information, social media links, KYC status, payment details, consent records for ToS/Privacy Policy versions)
    *   KYC Data (document references, verification status, timestamps, verifier ID if manual)
    *   Campaigns (details, criteria, budget, status, usage rights terms, brand association)
    *   Campaign Applications (influencer, campaign, status, proposal, submission timestamps)
    *   Content Submissions (files, links, review status, feedback, association with campaign usage rights, submission timestamps)
    *   AI Image Generation Requests (user, prompt, parameters, timestamp, intended use - e.g., personal, campaign-specific, status of the request (e.g., pending, processing, completed, failed), and reference to the generated image(s) or error details). [Completes the request lifecycle tracking]
    *   Generated Images (metadata, storage link/identifier, association to user/campaign, applicable usage rights, retention flags, generation parameters used, and a hash of the image file for integrity checks and potential deduplication). [Useful for auditing and verification]
    *   Usage Tracking Logs (for AI generation, API calls, feature usage)
    *   Payment Records (amount, status, transaction ID, associated campaign/influencer)
*   These models must define fields, data types, relationships between entities, and constraints (e.g., uniqueness, foreign keys, referential integrity).
*   **7.1.1 Data Dictionary:** A comprehensive data dictionary shall be maintained, detailing each data entity, attribute (including data type, size, constraints, description, source, PII classification, GDPR relevance, business rule associations), and relationships. This will be an extension of the ERD and regularly updated.
*   **7.1.2 Master Data Management (MDM) Strategy (Consideration):** For key entities like Influencer and Brand (if applicable), a strategy for managing master data should be considered to ensure consistency and accuracy across the platform, aligned with organizational data governance policies. This may involve defining golden records, data stewardship processes, and rules for data merging or conflict resolution.

**7.2 Data Validation**
*   The system shall implement robust data validation rules for all critical user inputs, both on the client-side (for immediate feedback) and server-side (for security and integrity).
*   Validation rules shall include:
    *   Format validation (e.g., email address format, URL format, date format, phone number format).
    *   Range validation (e.g., follower counts, budget amounts, age restrictions if applicable).
    *   Length validation (e.g., for text fields, prompt length).
    *   Required field checks.
    *   Uniqueness checks (e.g., email address, social media handle per platform).
    *   Business-specific rules (e.g., accepted ID document types, prompt content restrictions, valid social media handle patterns, campaign eligibility criteria). These rules are critical for platform operation and compliance and must be exhaustively documented in a dedicated Business Rules Register or equivalent controlled document, subject to periodic review and update.
    *   Cross-field validation (e.g., campaign end date must be after start date).
*   **7.2.1 Data Cleansing:** Processes for identifying and correcting or removing inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant data from influencer profiles or campaign data shall be established, particularly during initial data import or if data quality issues are detected through monitoring or user feedback. These processes are governed by data quality business rules. This may involve automated rules and manual review workflows.

**7.3 Data Retention and Archival**
*   Data retention policies shall be defined for different types of data, considering legal obligations (e.g., GDPR right to erasure, financial record keeping), business needs, and contractual agreements (e.g., usage rights for campaign content). These policies, including specific retention periods for all data categories, are critical business rules and must be formally documented, approved, and regularly reviewed. These policies must be clearly communicated in the platform's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
*   **PII and KYC Documents:** Define retention periods (e.g., for active users, and for a specific period post-account closure as legally required/permitted, typically not exceeding 7 years for financial/KYC data unless specific legal hold applies). Procedures for secure deletion or anonymization upon request (subject to legal/contractual constraints) or policy expiry must be in place and auditable.
    *   PII embedded within *formally submitted campaign content* (e.g., an influencer's image in a campaign post) may be subject to different retention rules based on agreed usage rights and platform ToS. If an influencer requests erasure of PII that is part of such content, the platform must assess this against the brand's legitimate interest and contractual usage rights. Options include anonymization if feasible, or if deletion is mandated by overriding legal requirements, the system must log this action for campaign records. This process requires careful legal review and clear articulation in the ToS and constitutes a complex business rule.
*   **Generated Images:** Define retention policies. These policies must be flexible enough to accommodate the duration of usage rights granted for campaign content.
    *   Images generated for personal exploration by an influencer (if such a feature exists and is distinct from campaign work) may be subject to a standard platform retention policy or user-controlled deletion, with clear communication to the user.
    *   Images formally submitted as part of a campaign and subject to specific usage rights must be retained for at least the duration of those rights, or as otherwise agreed with the brand/client and outlined in the ToS.
    *   The system shall provide a mechanism to flag or categorize images based on their association with campaign usage rights to manage differentiated retention periods.
    *   Platform agreements (e.g., with brands) should clarify image hosting policies, including any potential implications or fees for retention beyond standard periods or if brands are responsible for their own long-term archival.
    *   The system should allow administrators to document or flag when PII-laden campaign content cannot be deleted due to overriding usage rights or when it has been deleted despite usage rights due to a superseding legal obligation. This documentation is a business rule for compliance.
*   **N8N Logs and System Logs:** Define retention periods for operational logs (e.g., 90 days for detailed logs, longer for aggregated summaries if needed for trend analysis, balancing utility with storage costs and privacy). Audit logs (Section 9.1.1) may require longer retention based on compliance needs (e.g., 1-7 years).
*   Procedures for data archival (for long-term storage of inactive data) and secure deletion must be established and documented. A data disposition schedule should be formally documented, outlining retention periods for all key data categories and the processes for secure deletion or anonymization.
*   **7.3.1 Data Archival Strategy:** Define the strategy for archiving data that is no longer actively used but needs to be retained for compliance or historical purposes. This includes storage media (e.g., cold storage in cloud services), format (e.g., encrypted, compressed), access methods for archived data (including retrieval times), and restoration procedures.
*   **7.3.2 Legal Hold Capability:** The system should support a mechanism to place a legal hold on specific data (e.g., influencer accounts, campaign data, communications, generated images) in response to legal or regulatory requirements. Data under legal hold must be preserved from modification or deletion until the hold is lifted. This process must be auditable and is a critical legal and business constraint.

**8. Deployment and Infrastructure**

**8.1 Target Environments**
*   **Odoo Hosting:** The Odoo 18 instance with InfluenceGen modules will be hosted on [Specify: e.g., Odoo.sh, self-hosted on AWS/Azure/GCP, on-premises server]. The chosen environment must support Odoo 18 and its dependencies (e.g., PostgreSQL version 15+). [Specific Odoo dependency]
*   **N8N Hosting:** The N8N instance will be hosted on [Specify: e.g., N8N Cloud, self-hosted Docker container on AWS/Azure/GCP, Kubernetes]. The environment must allow network connectivity to Odoo and the AI image generation service. [Connectivity requirement]
*   **AI Model Serving Infrastructure:** The "Flux LoRA models" will be served via [Specify: e.g., a commercial AI platform API, a self-hosted GPU-enabled server with a framework like ComfyUI/Automatic1111, a cloud ML platform like SageMaker/Azure ML/Vertex AI]. If self-hosted, GPU availability and appropriate ML serving software (e.g., Triton Inference Server, TorchServe) are critical. Ensure sufficient VRAM (e.g., minimum 16GB, preferably 24GB+ per GPU for concurrent Flux LoRA model operations) for Flux LoRA models. [Specifics for self-hosted AI]
*   The choice of hosting environments must consider scalability, security, cost, manageability, and data residency requirements (which are legal/business constraints).
*   Network configurations must allow secure communication between Odoo, N8N, and the AI service. This may involve setting up VPCs/VNETs, firewalls, security groups, and potentially VPNs or private links depending on the hosting choices.

**8.2 Configuration Management**
*   The system shall support distinct configurations for different environments:
    *   **Development:** For active development and unit testing.
    *   **Staging (or UAT):** For integration testing, user acceptance testing, and pre-production validation.
    *   **Production:** The live environment for end-users.
*   Sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys, database credentials, AI model endpoints, encryption keys) must be managed securely across these environments, using methods such as:
    *   Environment variables.
    *   Secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Odoo's built-in mechanisms if sufficiently robust and audited).
*   Configuration deployment processes should be automated where possible to ensure consistency and reduce manual errors. Consider using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation, Bicep) for managing and provisioning environments.
*   **8.2.1 Environment Parity:** Staging environments should aim for parity with the production environment in terms of infrastructure (compute, storage, network), software versions (Odoo, N8N, OS, database), and configurations to ensure accurate testing and minimize deployment risks. Data in staging should be representative (e.g., anonymized production data subset as per Section 6.2.1).

**9. Operational Requirements**

**9.1 Logging, Monitoring, and Observability**
*   **Logging:**
    *   Comprehensive logging shall be implemented across all components (Odoo modules, N8N workflows, integration points, AI service interactions).
    *   Log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) should be configurable per component and environment.
    *   Logs should include timestamps (UTC), relevant context (e.g., user ID, campaign ID, request ID, correlation ID for cross-component tracing), and clear, structured messages (e.g., JSON format).
    *   A centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, cloud provider logging services like CloudWatch Logs or Azure Monitor Logs) should be implemented for aggregation, search, analysis, and alerting. Logs must be retained according to a defined policy (see Section 7.3) and be searchable/filterable for troubleshooting and auditing.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Key system metrics shall be monitored to assess health, performance, and usage. These include:
        *   API error rates and latencies (Odoo-N8N, N8N-AI, external KYC/payment services).
        *   Image generation success/failure rates and processing times (including callback success/failure and queue depths).
        *   Queue lengths for asynchronous tasks (if applicable, e.g., N8N workflow queues).
        *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk space, network I/O, GPU utilization for AI services) of Odoo, N8N, and AI serving instances.
        *   Database performance metrics (e.g., query latency, connection count, replication lag).
        *   User activity levels (e.g., registrations, campaign applications, content submissions, logins).
        *   KYC verification success/failure rates and processing times.
        *   Payment processing success/failure rates.
    *   Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, cloud provider monitoring tools) should be utilized. Dashboards should be created for key metrics to provide at-a-glance system health and should be reviewed regularly by the operations team.
*   **Observability:** The system should be designed to provide insights into its internal state, facilitating troubleshooting and performance analysis. This includes distributed tracing capabilities to follow requests across Odoo, N8N, and AI services.
*   **9.1.1 Audit Trail Requirements:**
    *   The system must maintain a comprehensive, tamper-evident audit trail of significant events and user actions. The specific list of events to be audited is determined by business risk assessment, operational needs, and regulatory compliance requirements, and forms part of the platform's business rules for security and accountability. These events particularly relate to:
        *   User login attempts (success and failure, source IP).
        *   Changes to user roles, permissions, and account status (activation, deactivation).
        *   Creation, modification, and deletion of PII and sensitive data.
        *   KYC status changes (submissions, approvals, rejections, information requests, verifier actions).
        *   Campaign creation, modification, deletion, and status changes (e.g., published, closed).
        *   Influencer application to campaigns, acceptance, and rejection.
        *   Content submission, approval, and rejection.
        *   Payment processing events (initiation, success, failure).
        *   Access to and export of sensitive data (e.g., PII, KYC documents, financial reports).
        *   Administrative actions (e.g., system configuration changes, user account management, manual data overrides).
        *   AI image generation requests, parameter changes, and image access/downloads.
        *   Consent management (e.g., ToS/Privacy Policy acceptance, updates).
    *   Audit logs must be secure, protected from unauthorized modification or deletion, and retained according to defined policies (see Section 7.3), typically longer than operational logs.
    *   Audit logs should include at least: timestamp (UTC), user ID (or system process ID), action performed, affected entity/data (e.g., record ID), source IP address (where applicable), and outcome (success/failure).
    *   Platform Administrators shall have access to review audit logs through a secure interface, with robust filtering, searching, and export capabilities for compliance and investigation purposes.

**9.2 Alerting**
*   Alerting mechanisms shall be established to notify relevant personnel of system failures, critical errors, performance degradation, and potential security incidents.
*   Critical conditions that should trigger alerts include, but are not limited to:
    *   High API error rates or sustained latency increases.
    *   AI image generation service unavailability or persistent failures (e.g., >X% failure rate over Y minutes).
    *   N8N workflow execution failures for critical processes, including callback delivery failures to Odoo.
    *   Critical resource thresholds breached (e.g., low disk space, high CPU/memory utilization on critical servers).
    *   Database connection issues or high replication lag.
    *   Security-related events (e.g., suspected breaches, multiple failed login attempts for admin accounts, unauthorized access attempts, critical vulnerabilities detected).
    *   KYC verification service outages or high failure rates.
    *   Payment processing failures.
    *   Backup job failures.
    *   SSL certificate expiry warnings.
*   Alerts should be directed to the appropriate teams/individuals (e.g., developers, operations, security, administrators) based on the nature and severity of the event.
*   Notification channels may include email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, or other incident management tools. Alerts should have defined severity levels (e.g., P1, P2, P3), clear descriptions of the issue, and escalation paths if not acknowledged or resolved within a defined timeframe, as per organizational incident management policy.

**9.3 System Administration and Maintenance**
*   **9.3.1 Administrative Interfaces:** Platform Administrators shall have dedicated interfaces within Odoo for managing users (creation, modification, deactivation), roles, permissions, campaigns, content, system configurations (e.g., AI model list, quotas, email templates, KYC settings, payment settings, business rule parameters), and viewing system health dashboards, operational logs, and audit logs.
*   **9.3.2 Patch Management:** A process for regularly reviewing (e.g., weekly/monthly), testing (in staging), and applying security patches and updates to Odoo, N8N, operating systems, databases, and other third-party components must be established and documented, adhering to organizational patch management policy (a business constraint). Critical security patches should be applied on an expedited basis.
*   **9.3.3 Scheduled Maintenance Windows:** Define procedures for scheduling and communicating maintenance windows (e.g., during off-peak hours) for system updates, upgrades, or other planned activities to minimize disruption to users. Communication should occur well in advance, following organizational communication protocols.
*   **9.3.4 Change Management Process:** A formal change management process, as defined by organizational policy, shall be implemented for deploying changes (code, configuration, infrastructure) to the production environment. Adherence to this process is a mandatory business constraint. This process must include request submission, impact assessment, review and approval by relevant stakeholders, testing in pre-production environments, deployment plan, rollback plan, and post-deployment validation and communication.

**9.4 Support and Incident Management**
*   **9.4.1 Incident Reporting and Tracking:** A system for users (influencers and administrators) to report issues and for the support team to track, prioritize, and manage incidents shall be in place (e.g., Odoo Helpdesk module, an external ticketing system like Jira Service Management or Zendesk), aligned with organizational support procedures.
*   **9.4.2 Support Tiers and Escalation:** Define support tiers (e.g., L1 for basic inquiries, L2 for technical troubleshooting, L3 for development/engineering) and clear escalation procedures for resolving incidents based on severity and complexity, as per organizational support SLAs (business constraints). SLAs for response and resolution times per severity level should be defined.
*   **9.4.3 Knowledge Base/FAQ:** A comprehensive and regularly updated knowledge base or FAQ section should be maintained and easily accessible to users (influencers and administrators) to provide self-service support for common user queries, troubleshooting steps, and platform usage guidance.

**9.5 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**
*   **9.5.1 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** A comprehensive DRP shall be developed, documented, and maintained, outlining procedures to recover system operations (Odoo, N8N, critical data) in the event of a major disaster affecting the primary hosting environment. This plan must align with the RPO (1 hour) and RTO (4 hours) defined in Section 6.4 and specify roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. The DRP is a critical business continuity constraint.
*   **9.5.2 DRP Testing:** The DRP shall be tested periodically (e.g., annually, or semi-annually for critical components) through tabletop exercises and/or partial/full failover tests to validate its effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and ensure staff familiarity with procedures. Test results and lessons learned must be documented.
*   **9.5.3 Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** A BCP should be developed to ensure critical business functions (e.g., influencer support, payment processing oversight, campaign management) can continue during and after a significant disruption. This plan should identify alternative processes and resources and is a key organizational requirement.
